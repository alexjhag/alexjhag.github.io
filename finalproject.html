	</div>
	<div id="main">
    <p>For this final analysis, I decided to take a step back and look at myths from a different perspective. Instead of looking for names,
    I looked for concepts. The research question that I developed, which would require a great deal more research, but could have a 
    starting place here, is as follows: What areas of life were considered more important to what cultures? How important was the sun or 
    sky in comparison to the sea or death? With these questions in mind, I chose to look at the Odyssey, Metamorphoses, and the Prose Edda, 
    which would cover Greek, Roman, and Norse culture. These were three of the major mythologies; I wanted to incorporate Egyptian, but 
    could not easily find a collection of myths that demonstrated the variety that was received from the others. For the purpose of this 
    analysis, Metamorphoses will be “Text 1” on the charts, The Odyssey will be Text 2, and the Prose Edda will be Text 3. To start, I 
    looked at the following frequency chart from Voyant:</p>

    <p>In this frequency chart, I chose five big ideas that would come up frequently in most mythologies: sun, sea, sky, dead, and king. 
    The goal of this method was to determine with what frequency each concept was used, and in which texts they were most often used. There 
    were three things that I noticed immediately. The first was the consistent frequency of the word “sea.” This appears to demonstrate 
    that each culture held a high regard for the sea, in comparison to the other ideas that I analyzed. The second was the consistent 
    infrequency of the word “sky,” which demonstrates that, despite having gods for the sky, these ancient cultures did not value the sky 
    nearly as much, despite some of their kings being gods of the sky. This brings me to the final point, where “king” blends in for the 
    Odyssey and Metamorphoses, but has a drastic jump in frequency when looking at the Prose Edda. What was it about Norse culture that 
    held such a high importance for kings? Or am I misunderstanding how kings are looked at? To help answer that question, I wanted to 
    look at some of the context in which “king” was used, so moved over to another tool Voyant offers.</p>

     <p>This allows a person to see, in context, how these words and phrases are being used. I specifically focused on king, since I 
     noticed how important it was in the Prose Edda. What I found was rather interesting. Based on the contexts that I found, the Norse 
     myths in the Prose Edda placed an emphasis not just on the gods in reference to “king,” as I was thinking about it, but talked a lot
     about the mortal kings that ruled in Midgard. This has opened a few new potential routes a research, namely looking at the 
     prevalence and importance of mortal kings to Norse culture. This developing research question was challenged, though, when I looked 
     at the correlations between the term “king” and terms that have similar rise and fall patterns to it. These correlations can be 
     seen here: </p>

    <p>In the Prose Edda, there is a higher correlation between “gods” and “king” than there is between “man” and “king,” even though the 
    correlation between “man” and “king” is much higher throughout the entire corpus. This presents a limit of the Voyant analysis, 
    because without actually reading the texts, I cannot fully understand these correlations and how the terms come together to create 
    this dataset. However, all of this comes together to demonstrate that, despite my initial hypothesis that some of the deities of the 
    sky would be more prevalent – I expected to see a much higher prevalence of “sun” than there is – it is actually the kings that are 
    more talked about in my selections. It would be interesting, in an even further analysis, to expand my corpus even more and to see 
    how these same datasets look when the corpus is bigger and has more text to analyze.</p>
