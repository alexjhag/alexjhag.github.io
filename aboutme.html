		<p>Alexander Hagood has spent a lot of time exploring his academic interests. He has had many attempts to get off the ground, the first of which was
		music. However, due to many circumstances, music did not work out. After much soul searching, Alexander ended up at the Indiana University of
		Pennsylvania(IUP) studying <a href="https://www.iup.edu/english/undergrad/majors/english-education-bsed/">Secondary English Education</a>. This was the
		degree that he completed as his undergraduate degree.</p>

		<p>However, something didn't feel quite right. He loved teaching, and he loved English, but there was something about the secondary level that didn't
		work for him. With that in mind, Alexander chose to stay at IUP and continue working on his position in the field of English. At this point in his life,
		he didn't know what specifically he wanted to study. He had a lot of different ideas and a lot of different interests, but could not quite make sense of
		these ideas in a way that made sense to him. To help him determine his goals, he began the Master's program at IUP in <a href="
		https://www.iup.edu/english/grad/composition-literature-ma/">Composition and Literature</a>. During this program, Alexander took time to reflect on
		his academic career as far as he could remember to determine what he might want to do.</p>
		<p>It wasn't until he took a class with Dr. Tanya Heflin, a class that explore magical realism, that he began to realize that some of his long-standing
		interests - such as folktales and fairytales - could be taken seriously as a field of study. It was this realization, and the fact that he had recently
		been reading Rick Riordan's award winning series, <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</i>, that he made his decision to study Mythology and Folktales as
		his field of scholarly study.</p>

		<p>Alexander now continues his education at IUP, pursuing his PhD in Literature and Criticism, focusing on Mythology and Folklore as literature. His other
		scholarly interests include adaptation theory, young adult literature, and late American literature. He hopes to teach literature at the post-secondary
		level.</p>
